# 🟢 Flutterwave Integration Setup Complete

## ✅ What Changed
- **Switched from Monnify to Flutterwave** for virtual account creation
- **Updated environment variables** with your provided credentials
- **Migrated API endpoints** to use Flutterwave's Virtual Account Numbers API
- **Enhanced error handling** and logging for better debugging

## 🔑 Flutterwave Credentials (Configured)
```env
FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK-17af0e85f8d15d9e37963feee2c50051-X
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK-38f1d3131e56b3c67d986712544e1a8d-1980f5f60ccvt-X  
FLUTTERWAVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=38f1d3131e56af9c182e4ae9
FLUTTERWAVE_BASE_URL=https://api.flutterwave.com/v3
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test

### 1. Test Flutterwave Connection
```bash
curl -X GET "https://f142675f2ac4.ngrok-free.app/api/test-flutterwave"
```

### 2. Test Virtual Account Creation
Set `USE_MOCK_ACCOUNTS=false` in `.env` and try creating a virtual account through your app.

## 📋 Key Features

### Virtual Account Creation
- **Permanent accounts** linked to user BVN
- **Automatic account generation** with user details
- **Encrypted BVN storage** for security
- **Multiple bank support** through Flutterwave

### Mock Account System
- **Configurable fallback** when `USE_MOCK_ACCOUNTS=true`
- **Seamless switching** between mock and real accounts
- **Development-friendly** for testing without API limits

## 🔧 API Endpoints Updated

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/test-flutterwave` - Test Flutterwave connection
- `POST /api/create-virtual-account` - Now uses Flutterwave API

### Request Format (Same as before)
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "bvn": "12345678901",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Virtual account created successfully with Flutterwave",
  "data": {
    "accountNumber": "1234567890",
    "bankName": "WEMA BANK",
    "accountName": "John Doe",
    "accountReference": "flw_ref_123",
    "balance": 0.00,
    "provider": "Flutterwave"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the integration** with real user data
2. **Verify account creation** works with actual BVNs
3. **Set up webhooks** for payment notifications (future)
4. **Monitor transactions** through Flutterwave dashboard

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Virtual Account Creation Fails
1. Check Flutterwave credentials are valid
2. Verify BVN format (11 digits)
3. Ensure user email is verified
4. Check server logs for specific errors

### Enable Mock Accounts for Testing
```env
USE_MOCK_ACCOUNTS=true
```
